PROJECT -1 
THE NUMBER GAME
Description - Here this is simple console (command line) based project in which the user is asked to input a number between 1 to 20 and the answer is also between 1 to 20. The user gets 5 attempts and if the user does not suceed then it has an option to continue and get another 5 attempts or just quit the game. Many Exceptions are handled here to make the game run in various scenarios.
